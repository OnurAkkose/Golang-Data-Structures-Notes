# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of a list and moving it to the beginning (or end).

Algorithm Steps

- Assume that the first element of the list is the smallest.
- Traverse through the list to find the smallest element.
- Once found, swap it with the first element of the list.
- The first element is now sorted, and the loop continues starting from the second element.

## Insertion Sort

It works similarly to how you might sort playing cards in your hand: by taking one card at a time and inserting it into the correct position among the already sorted cards.

## Merge Sort

It operates on the principle of "Divide and Conquer." The array is divided at each step until each element becomes its own array. In the final step, these arrays are sorted and merged together.

## Quick Sort

It follows a method where a pivot is selected from the list, and the remaining numbers are classified based on whether they are greater or smaller than this pivot. It operates on the principle of divide and conquer. The divide and sort process continues within the sub-lists that have been split.
